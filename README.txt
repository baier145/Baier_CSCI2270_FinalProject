This project is created to help college students in the Boulder area determine the relative cost of living in the various
towns around Boulder. The idea is that all the student has to enter is the amount of roommates they will have as well as
the rent cost and what town the unit is in, and the program will automatically add on average costs for water, waste disposal,
electricity, internet, heating, and other utilities, as well as gas to CU Boulder, if the student wishes these to be added. If
the city is not found in the list of nearby communities then the program will request another city from the user.
